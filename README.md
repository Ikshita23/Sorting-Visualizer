# Sorting-Visualizer
Welcome to Sorting Visualizer!
It is a web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

`Implemented algorithms:-`
1. Bubble sort
2. Selection sort
3. Insertion sort
4. Merge sort
5. Quick sort
6. Heap sort

`Features:-`
Colored representation of step being executed:
1) Blue: Default 
2) Yellow: Being compared
3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
4) Green: In correct position
   
Controls for visualizations:
1) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)
2) 2) Data size ()
3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
4) Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
